# HCC-CNN-Classificator
A simple convolutional neural network made using pytorch for Human-Computer-Communication course, the net scored 80% accuracy after training on the Intel dataset.
My object was to implement image classification in any method I desire.

#Data set
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification/version/2)

The data was split between 3 sets, training, validation and train set

I trained a couple of models and accuracy on test set was between 79-81% which I accepted as good result for my use case
